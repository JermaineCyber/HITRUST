    <h1>HITRUST Compliance Framework</h1>
    <p>The HITRUST (Health Information Trust Alliance) framework is designed to provide organizations with a comprehensive, flexible, and efficient approach to regulatory compliance and risk management. The framework harmonizes various regulatory requirements and best practices, creating a single, unified standard that ensures the protection of sensitive health information. HITRUST covers a wide range of security and privacy controls, helping organizations manage and mitigate risks effectively. By implementing the HITRUST framework, organizations can ensure they meet stringent security requirements, maintain regulatory compliance, and protect patient data from potential threats. This framework is particularly useful for healthcare organizations, providing them with the necessary tools and guidance to build a robust information security management program.</p>
